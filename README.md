# Project Summary
The SNHU Travel Project was created to simulate the design and development of a travel booking website. The goal was to create a system that allows users to explore destinations, view travel packages, and make reservations in an intuitive and engaging way. This project emphasized understanding user needs, applying Agile development concepts, and collaborating as a team to produce a well-designed and functional solution.

# Reflection
Interpreting User Needs and User Stories
When developing software, I start by identifying what the user truly needs from the system. I interpret user needs by breaking them down into clear, actionable goals and features that the program must deliver. Creating user stories is one of the most effective ways to do this because they describe functionality from the user’s perspective — for example, “As a traveler, I want to search for destinations so that I can plan my next vacation.”
These stories keep the focus on what matters most to the end user and ensure that the design and implementation always align with their expectations. They also make it easier to prioritize tasks and communicate requirements within a development team.

# Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Processes
When approaching development, I like to start by planning out the major components of the program, then break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. I’ve learned to value iterative development, where the program grows and improves through small, testable changes rather than one big final version.
In future projects, I plan to incorporate Agile processes such as sprints, daily standups, and retrospectives. These techniques help teams stay organized, communicate effectively, and remain flexible when requirements change. Agile encourages continuous feedback and improvement, which leads to better software and a more collaborative environment.

# Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member means more than just writing code — it means communicating clearly, being dependable, and supporting others to achieve the team’s shared goals. It involves listening to feedback, being open to new ideas, and maintaining professionalism even when challenges arise. Good teamwork creates a strong development culture where everyone contributes to producing high-quality, user-focused software.

# Lessons Learned
This project helped me understand the importance of user-centered design, collaboration, and flexibility in software development. I learned how to turn user needs into structured stories, how Agile methods improve project organization, and how teamwork plays a crucial role in creating successful software.
